    <h1>Gardening</h1>
    <p>For me, gardening is all about GROWING FOOD. </p>
    <p>The photo in the header is actually a my hand holding a tomato I had growing on a vine last summer. Each year I add new seeds to my garden and look forward to this sewing season!</p>

        <h1>Eating</h1>
        <p>Yes I know everyone has to eat to live, But eating for me is more of an experience .</p>
        <p>My love for growing food and my love for travel tie in with the fave perfectly. There is satisfaction in eating something you have nurtured from seed. There is adventure in traveling to a distant place and trying foods you would never find in your home country. </p>

        <h1>Creating</h1>
        <p>I have always been interested in Creating things. Wther that be PAINTING, SCULPTING, GARDENING or CODING!.</p>
        <p>This fave encompasses every other thing I mentioned before. There is a level of creating when you work with the soil & seeds to grow fruits and vegetables. The code is already created there in the seed, Im just facilitating it. I create memorable experiences from traveling and Create delicious wholesome mreals to eat. Last but bot least, my love for creating will follow me in my coding career! </p>
